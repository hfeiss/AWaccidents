She said, &quot;He&#39;s ok, he&#39;s waiting for us right behind that bend.&quot; I kept crying and shivering and coughing. It took forever for the other rafters to help us get our raft and paddles back. I spotted two of the rafters from the first raft walking back up the railroad tracks with paddles for us. We had to paddle from the right side of the river to the left to pick them up. The first thing I asked was, &quot;Is Jerry ok??? Did you pick him up?&quot; One of them, an English one, said, &quot;Yes, we picked him up.&quot; I was so relieved. I said, &quot;Oh, Thank God.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tThen we started down the river again. I started joking to the English guy about our &quot;wipeout&quot;. I said, &quot;How did it look?&quot; He said, &quot;Oh, there were bodies everywhere&quot;, but he didn&#39;t sound very amused. As we went around the bend (the bend Jerry disappeared behind), there were a lot more rough rapids. I remember thinking, &quot;Oh my God! Jerry had to swim through this????&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tAt one point, we stopped our raft at a private landing. The raft guide from the other raft got out and talked to some people for a while. I remember thinking, &quot;Geez, I wish he&#39;d hurry up!&quot; As we were waiting for him, our raft guide said, &quot;That has NEVER happened to me before. I thought we should have taken the rapid from the left, but everyone else decided to take it through the middle. I knew we should have gone to the left.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, finally we were moving again. As we neared the landing, I started looking for Jerry. Where is he? Where are the other rafters? Where&#39;s the van? Why are there all these sheriffs department vehicles around? Why is one the officers questioning our raft guide? I though, hmmm they must investigate every time there&#39;s a serious rafting accident.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen one of the officers approached me. He said, &quot;Are you Shirley?&quot; I said, &quot;What?&quot; He said, &quot;Are you Jerry Montemayor&#39;s fiancee?&quot; Then I knew something was wrong. I knew something was horribly horribly wrong. I started getting frantic. I started asking &quot;Why? What&#39;s going on? What&#39;s going on? Where&#39;s Jerry?&quot; He said, &quot;Ma&#39;am, I can&#39;t tell you. Please calm down, I need to ask you some questions.&quot; Then he started asking me his address, his age, his profession, his parents names. I was getting hysterical. I begged him to tell me what was going on. He said, &quot;All I can tell you is they took him away in an ambulance, and they&#39;re working on him.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tI don&#39;t remember much of what I said or did after he told me that. I think I started crying. I think I started pacing around frantically saying, &quot;No, no no no no no no no God no no.&quot; Then, a plain white car pulled up. A very serious sad looking woman stepped out, spoke to an officer who then pointed towards me.</p>\n<p>\n\tI knew. I knew he was dead, but I didn&#39;t want to know. I turned around and started running away from her. She caught up with me, grabbed me by my arms, looked me straight in the eyes and said, &quot;JERRY&#39;S DEAD.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p>\n\tI screamed and I screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed. I fell against a rock and kept screaming and screaming and screaming. I think my Dad and Nick were standing there. I don&#39;t remember. Then I looked over towards the river. Our raft guide was on his hands and knees crying. For some bizarre, inexplicable reason, I walked over to him, put my hand on his back, and said, &quot;It&#39;s not your fault. Don&#39;t blame yourself.&quot; I still don&#39;t know how or why I did that. Then the Rafting leader hugged me and we cried. Then I started getting frantic, hysterical I was pacing pacing pacing. I couldn&#39;t be still. I&#39;ve tried to recreate the events from this point forth as they happened:</p>\n<p>\n\tI&#39;m pacing and talking out loud. &quot;No, this isn&#39;t happening. We&#39;re buying two basset hound puppies when we get home. We&#39;re getting married next year. We&#39;re taking Nick to Arkansas this week. No, this isn&#39;t happening. I just got home. Somebody wake me up. I don&#39;t like this.&quot; I can&#39;t sit down, I can&#39;t stop pacing trying to figure out what really just happened. This can&#39;t be real. IT CAN&#39;T!!!! THEY TOLD ME HE WAS OK. THEY TOLD ME HE GOT PICKED UP. He was right there. He was right in front of me. I could have grabbed him. I could have swam over to him and grabbed him. He was right there. He was so close.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy Dad is pleading with the social worker, &quot;Can&#39;t you sedate her?&quot; &quot;No, she&#39;s doing what she needs to do.&quot; Nick is saying over and over, &quot;I love you Aunt Julie, I love you Aunt Julie.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tI need a phone. Someone give me a phone so that I can page Pat. Pat fixes everything. Pat will fix this. Please, give me a cell phone. It doesn&#39;t work it doesn&#39;t work there are too many boulders around or something. Oh God, somebody help me get a hold of Pat. I can&#39;t get this cell phone to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore questions from the officer. What is his parent&#39;s address? No No don&#39;t go to his parents house. They&#39;re elderly. Find his brother, Junior. Find Junior. Oh God, I forgot the city where Junior lives. He works at NASA I don&#39;t remember the company name I can&#39;t think. Don&#39;t go to his parents whatever you do don&#39;t go to his parents. His sister Maria she lives in Webster. Find her. Find Her. Maria Montemayor. Webster. Don&#39;t go to his parents. They&#39;re trying to get me to change out of my wetsuit. No. No. No. I don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t want to. This is a dream. This is just a nightmare. I don&#39;t need to get out of this wetsuit, because I&#39;m dreaming this.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen the social worker asks me, &quot;Do you want me to take you to him?&quot; I start crying. Oh God, I don&#39;t want to see him dead. He&#39;s not dead. If I see him dead, then he&#39;ll really be dead. I say, &quot;Am I supposed to?&quot; She says, &quot;It&#39;s whatever you need to do for closure.&quot; In my ultimate moment of complete denial and cowardice, I say, &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to see him dead.&quot; I&#39;m thinking he&#39;ll be stiff and cold, zipped up in a body bag in a metal drawer. His eyes and mouth will be open. I&#39;m afraid. Besides, this is all just a bad dream. Can&#39;t someone wake me up??? Please! Somebody wake me up!</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, they coax me into the white car. I&#39;m in a daze. I can&#39;t figure out what just happened. I just can&#39;t comprehend it. We&#39;re at a building. It looks like an old-style courthouse. It&#39;s sheriff&#39;s department. We are taken upstairs in a room with some desks and phones. I don&#39;t want to change my clothes. I don&#39;t want to take my suit off. I have to call Pat. I need to get Pat. Pat fixes everything. The sheriffs department tells us NOT to call Jerry&#39;s family. We can not call his family. It is being handled through their local police department.</p>\n<p>\n\tI page Pat frantically with 911s. He calls back. I&#39;m crying. Jerry&#39;s dead. He needs to call Robert (Jerry&#39;s best friend). Pat, don&#39;t tell Jerry&#39;s family. We can&#39;t tell Jerry&#39;s family they won&#39;t let us.</p>\n<p>\n\tI call my sister. &quot;There&#39;s been an accident. Nick&#39;s ok but Jerry&#39;s dead&quot; She&#39;s saying &quot;Oh my God&quot;. She&#39;s crying. I call my boss, Kathy Roberts. I&#39;m crying. She&#39;s saying, &quot;Honey, what&#39;s the matter, tell me what&#39;s the matter.&quot; I tell her. She starts to cry.</p>\n<p>\n\tNo! No! I don&#39;t want to change out of my wetsuit. Pacing, more pacing. What is happening? What is going on? This can&#39;t be real. This isn&#39;t real. Oh God, what am I going to do? What am I going to do?</p>\n<p>\n\tOk. I&#39;ll change into my dry clothes. They have my bag. Another social worker walks me to a bathroom. I&#39;m in a haze. I can&#39;t walk in a straight line. I look at the woman and I tell her, &quot;Gee, some job you have.&quot; Why did I say this? I go into the stall and put my jeans and sweatshirt on.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&#39;m back in the room with the phones and desks. Someone is there to pick up my wetsuit.</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to see our raft guide. He&#39;s downstairs being questioned. They take me to him. I say, &quot;I wanted to see if you were alright.&quot; He looks up at me and says, &quot;I have a wife. I&#39;m sorry. I have a wife, and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do if this happened to her.&quot; Something like that I can&#39;t remember. We hold hands in silence. I ask him if I am making him uncomfortable. He says no, that it&#39;s ok.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow they&#39;re putting me back in the car. They take us to some sort of meeting hall. There, the other rafters are waiting for us in a conference room. The van is parked out front. The rafts are tied up on a trailer. Everyone is looking at me. Why are we here?</p>\n<p>\n\tI still have a social worker with me. My Dad is asking the other rafters what they saw. I hear bits and pieces. &quot;We did CPR.&quot; and some other stuff. I don&#39;t want to hear this. This isn&#39;t happening. Make them be quiet. Make them be quiet. I put my hands over my ears. I start hyperventilating. The social worker puts me in the bathroom. She&#39;s helping me breath. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey put my Dad, nephew, and I in the backseat of the truck pulling the trailer with the rafts. The raft leader is driving by himself in the front seat. Dad is saying, &quot;We&#39;ll fix this. We&#39;ll fix this.&quot; over and over. He keeps trying to force my head to his shoulder. I don&#39;t want it there. I don&#39;t want it there. Nick? Are you ok? &quot;I love you Aunt Julie.&quot; I say, &quot;Did I not backpaddle right? Was I not backpaddling right?&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tWe drive and drive for 2 hours back to Colorado Springs. The river runs to our left. I&#39;m sitting in the middle of the backseat on the edge of the seat holding on to the back of the front seat. I&#39;m not crying. I&#39;m just staring. I&#39;m gripping the front seat like I&#39;m on a carnival ride. When am I going to get out of this truck? When am I going to wake up? I don&#39;t like this. Dad is saying stuff. I don&#39;t remember. It&#39;s stuff like &quot;We&#39;ll fix this. I&#39;ll do anything for you.&quot; I see tears running down the raft leader&#39;s face. He puts his hand on his face a lot. When am I going to get out of this truck? We stop for gas. I wander in the bathroom. I&#39;m in the bathroom. What am I doing here? What is happening? Where am I? I come out of the bathroom. The people standing around stand aside as I walk out. It&#39;s quiet. No one is talking. They&#39;re just staring at me.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe&#39;re driving again. When am I going to get out of this truck? It&#39;s getting dark. It&#39;s starting to rain. The road is winding. Can&#39;t we drive any faster?</p>\n<p>\n\tWe get back to the rec center in Colorado Springs. It&#39;s drizzling. Where&#39;s Jerry&#39;s stuff? Where&#39;s his wallet? I need his baseball cap. Somebody please find me his baseball cap. Where is it? I&#39;m standing in the middle of the parking lot. There are people all around. A pretty woman walks up to me crying. She says she&#39;s the wife of our raft guide. I don&#39;t remember what she says to me. I was crying. She hugged me. She said, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; I need Jerry&#39;s baseball cap. I&#39;m crying. I&#39;m standing in the middle of the parking lot in the rain yelling for someone to please find his baseball cap.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey put us back in the van. They take us to some sort of hotel on the airforce base. They put us in a sort-of apartment. There is a chaplain there. He&#39;s wearing a uniform. Somebody asks if I want coffee. No. There&#39;s a phone on a desk. Dad Dad call Uncle Rod. He needs to go tell Mom. Don&#39;t call Mom when she&#39;s at home alone. Call Rod. Can&#39;t get a hold of Rod. Keep trying.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy sister, Christie. She&#39;s on her way to Colorado Springs with her boyfriend, Mark. Where&#39;s Christie? Where is she? It will get better when she gets here. I need my sister. I keep looking out the window for her. It&#39;s dark and raining. More pacing. We&#39;re getting married next year. We&#39;re buying two basset hounds when we get home. We&#39;re going to name them Claude and Cleofus. Jerry likes the name Cleofus. The chaplain tells me that Cleopus (with a p) is a name from the bible. He says &quot;Did you know that?&quot; More pacing. The chaplain is following me around the room as I walk circles around it. He&#39;s trying to console me. I show him pictures of Jerry on my digital camera. He says he&#39;s a fine looking young man. Look out the window. Where&#39;s Christie? She&#39;s on her way.</p>\n<p>\n\tAir Force officials start coming in. They&#39;re talking to my Dad. I&#39;m pacing. Try to call Rod again. It&#39;s getting late. We need to call people. We need to call people. Where&#39;s Christie? Call Aunt Mary instead. Call Aunt Mary. She&#39;ll go over and tell Mom. Mary is there. She&#39;s there. She&#39;ll tell my Mom. She&#39;ll go over there and tell my Mom. We&#39;re moving. They&#39;re putting us in a Red Roof Inn. Why? We get in another van. We go to the lobby. The chaplain is with us. I&#39;m hiding behind him. I don&#39;t want the people in the lobby to see me. They&#39;re staring because I&#39;m crying. Where&#39;s Christie? Christie is here. She&#39;s on her way down.</p>\n<p>\n\tOh God, there she is. I grabbed her. I&#39;m crying and crying and crying. Christie says she&#39;ll get me upstairs. We&#39;ll go upstairs, ok? We walk up the stairs. Our rooms are too far apart. We get a new room next to where Dad, Nick and Mark are sleeping. They have his hat and his things! They have his things! Nick said, &quot;Here, Aunt Julie, here&#39;s his shirt.&quot; It&#39;s a shirt he bought in Hawaii when we went there last October.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have his shirt. I have his baseball cap. I have his moneyclip. Where&#39;s his wallet? I need his wallet. The police have his wallet. We can&#39;t have it.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&#39;m in this room with Christie. I can&#39;t sit down. What just happened? What just happened? I don&#39;t understand. Is this a dream? Can&#39;t I just wake up? Pacing. More pacing. I cling to Jerry&#39;s things. I look at them. Here are his things. Where is he? I stand in the corner of the room with my forehead pressed to the wall. This isn&#39;t happening. I need to call people. I need to call. Christie gets out her calling card. We start to call people from a phone list I have. I need to talk to Robert. But it&#39;s 3 o&#39;clock in the morning. I need to call. I don&#39;t remember what I said to Robert.</p>\n<p>\n\tI need to call Becky (my best friend from high school). Becky! Becky!!! Jerry&#39;s dead. She&#39;s crying. Call Greg and Maria in New York. I need to tell them. I don&#39;t remember what I said to them or what they said to me. Keep calling people. More pacing. I walk outside. It&#39;s cold. Is there someplace way over there where I can jump in the water? Is this jump from here enough to kill me? I&#39;ll run. I&#39;ll run. No, I can&#39;t leave Christie here.</p>\n<p>\n\tI lay down on the bed. When is morning going to get here? I hug Jerry&#39;s shirt, cap, and money clip. It can&#39;t be true that he&#39;ll never wear this cap again. No, it can&#39;t be true.</p>\n<p>\n\tMorning arrives. We go to the airport. I&#39;m crying. Christie is pulling me behind her by my hand. Nick, Mark, and Dad are driving to Amarillo. Dad lost his glasses in the river, and he can&#39;t see to drive. I&#39;m still holding Jerry&#39;s things. We get on the plane. I stop crying. I don&#39;t cry on the plane. I&#39;m in a daze. The clouds out there. Which one is Jerry on? When are we going to get there?</p>\n<p>\n\tWe land. I start crying. I&#39;m in Houston. I left Jerry up there. Oh my God, I didn&#39;t bring him home. I left him in Colorado. Christie leads me off the plane by my hand. I&#39;m still holding Jerry&#39;s things.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy boss, Kathy, my friends, Jim and Pat they&#39;re there waiting for me. I see them and I start crying. I can&#39;t move. My feet won&#39;t move. They&#39;re standing around me. Kathy says, come on, let&#39;s go.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe get in Kathy&#39;s car. She&#39;s parked on the roof. She asked me where I wanted to go. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. She says, &quot;Why don&#39;t you call his family.&quot; I guess they know by now. They dial the number. Maria answers the phone. I start to cry. She starts to cry. She said, &quot;Come over here and be with us.&quot; I said ok. I&#39;m still holding Jerry&#39;s things.</p>\n<p>\n\tLong drive to Friendswood from Intercontinental Airport. I don&#39;t cry. I&#39;m in a haze. I look down at the door the entire way. What am I going to say to them? I took Jerry away, now he&#39;s dead. Why did I take him there? We arrive at his parents house. I see the familiar &quot;Montemayor&quot; family sign on the fence. Oh my God. This is happening. This is really happening. What am I going to say? What am I going to say?</p>\n<p>\n\tI have to be helped from the car. I&#39;m still holding Jerry&#39;s things. The backgate opens. Junior is coming towards me. I freeze. I cry. I cry and cry and cry. Everyone in the family is there. They&#39;re all in there. I&#39;m here. I&#39;m alive. I&#39;m at Jerry&#39;s house and he&#39;s dead. This doesn&#39;t make any sense at all. It should have been me.</p>\n<p>\n\tJunior helps me into the house. Everyone is there. I&#39;m crying. I sit down. They take his things from me. I tell them that Jerry may not have said it much, but he&#39;s loves every one of you. He loves you all very much. It was an accident. It was an accident. It was an accident. I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;m so sorry. He was just a few feet from me. I could have grabbed him. It was an accident. Junior is there. He&#39;s trying to calm me down.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristie gets the dentist she works for to prescribe a sedative. I take it. The rest of the day is a blur. Junior, his wife, Melissa, Jerry&#39;s brother James, his wife Brenda, Christie, and I go to the funeral home close to his parent&#39;s house. It smells funny. There&#39;s a big room. Kind of pale green. That&#39;s where the viewing will be. We go into an office. We sit at the table. I&#39;m crying off and on. Do we want a newspaper article? Do we want a flower arrangement for the casket? What kind of vault do we want to purchase? I say, &quot;Unsealed we were watching the discovery channel one day a show about mortuary science they described what happens to the body in a sealed up vault. Jerry said it was gross. He didn&#39;t want to be sealed up.&quot; I don&#39;t want cheap carnations for the top of his casket.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe go into the next room into a room full of caskets. I&#39;m crying. This can&#39;t be real. We really can&#39;t be looking for a casket for Jerry. I like this one the cherrywood one. Jerry loved Cherrywood everything. He would have liked this one. It&#39;s expensive. James and Brenda decide to go find one like it in The Woodlands.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe&#39;re in the car again. We drive through cemeteries. I&#39;m sitting in the front seat with Junior. He&#39;s holding my hand. He asks me what I should be called in the obituary. I start crying. I said, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Junior starts crying. Somebody suggests &quot;fiancee&quot;. But I don&#39;t have a ring. We didn&#39;t buy a ring yet. Yeah. It&#39;ll say fiancee for me. We find a Catholic cemetery in Dickinson. Jerry&#39;s mom would like that.</p>\n\n"
